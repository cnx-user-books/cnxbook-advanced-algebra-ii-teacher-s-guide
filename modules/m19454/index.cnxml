    <para id="id10994998">This unit is really three different topics, joined together by a somewhat weak thread.</para>
    <para id="id11298945">The first topic is direct and inverse variation. The second topic is finding a parabola that fits any three given points. The third topic is regression on a calculator.</para>
    <para id="id9597760">The weak thread that connects them is that they all involve starting with data, and finding a function that models that data. (At least, the latter topics are clearly about that, and the first topic is about that if you approach it the way I doâ€¦)</para>
